v All of the above 

290) (open question) Describe the three logical components of an IDS
> Sensor: it has responsibility in collecting data; input includes network packets, log files, system call traces.
> Analyzer: receiving input from one or more sensors, responsible for determining if an intrusion has occurred The output of this component is an indication that an intrusion has occurred and may include evidence supporting the conclusion that an intrusion has occurred
